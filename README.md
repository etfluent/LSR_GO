# LSR_GO

This is the initial source code for the LSR_GO Storm Response System developed by Michael Culpepper, Farid Oudraego, and Jordi VanWinkle.

The system uses a javascript map UI with Chrome browser GPS services to give your location. You are then opted in to receiving push notification if weather in your area causes a site admin to push weather warnings. Also available is a kml weather layer in order to see current weather patterns based on your location on a map. This layer is updated by NOAA. The Youtube demo can be found here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGlRCpQv77w" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGlRCpQv77w</a>

Installation notes:

1. You will need to setup your wp-config file ;)

2. You will need to update .htaccess file, Google Map API keys, manifest.json, and site link names

3. Code is not trimmed or finalized by any means

4. Code is dated and not currently maintained, expect to do some updating and troubleshooting ;)

5. This is intended for review purposes, but feel free to use it if you find it helpful :)
